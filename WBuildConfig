# Wyvern build configuration file
#
# This is not the kernel configuration file. It is used to describe how to
# build wyvern, not how it should be configured (i.e. what features should
# be built). The file to modify kernel configuration is, by default, called
# KConfig and is in the root wyvern source directory.
